    %p The AUBG MultiTalent Quest is organized and supported by the AUBG Alumni Association. The Prizes Fund is collected through individual donations from alumni and friends of AUBG, who believe in the bright prospects that AUBG offers to its students. The sponsors of the competition believe that encouraging 11-grade high school students to participate in the competition will help them obtain a valuable preliminary experience from the Universityâ€™s unique atmosphere and campus.
    %p The Organizing Team consists of members of the AUBG alumni, students, faculty, and administration. It is supported by the AUBG Alumni Association and AUBG Students from the specially created AUBG MultiTalent Quest Club, AUBG Student Debating Club, AUBG Olympics, and others.
